Welcome to my project ""(Deep) Neural Network-based Speech Enhancement".

The goal is to remove noise of an audio file via a neural network.
At the moment the project is still in its beginnings, but I am (more or less)
steadily working on it.

I'll perform a first run on friday. Next week I'll try to generate first audio files.

I'm kind of busy at the moment, so things are going far slower than I want them to.
